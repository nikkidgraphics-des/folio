# **\[H2\]** **Improving Imports: Transforming Legacy Support Operations**

\[subtitle1\]

Leading a cross-functional initiative to modernize a 20-year-old imports system, reducing support costs and improving user experience through strategic UX research and AI-powered automation.

**$X Annual**  
Support Cost Reduction  
**13 Years**  
Highest Support Volume Issue  
**AI-Powered**  
Automated Resolution System

## **Business Problem & Strategic Goals**

### **The Challenge**

For 13 consecutive years, the imports functionality had been the highest support volume area, costing the 20-year-old company significant resources annually. The system was plagued by:

* Custom configurations for every client that were reused across simple to extremely complex use cases  
* Complete lack of documentation about import statuses and architectural diagrams  
* Difficult-to-understand error messages that made troubleshooting nearly impossible  
* Critical errors surfaced to clients that only internal teams could resolve

### **Strategic Goals**

Transform the imports process from a cost center to a competitive advantage by reducing support volume, improving user experience, and enabling future self-service capabilities through strategic automation and AI integration.

## **My Leadership Role & Approach**

### **Leadership Responsibilities**

As the strategic lead for this initiative, I spearheaded the transformation from a reactive support model to a proactive, data-driven approach. My role encompassed:

* Leading comprehensive UX research to decode 13 years of support mysteries  
* Coordinating cross-functional teams across Product, Engineering, and Support  
* Designing and implementing a systematic research methodology  
* Championing AI integration as a strategic solution for legacy constraints

### **Strategic Approach**

Implemented a methodical, research-first approach that combined quantitative data analysis with qualitative error investigation, ensuring every solution was grounded in actual user pain points and business impact metrics.

## **Key Initiatives & Solutions**

### **Phase 1: Strategic Research & Analysis**

#### Needs Review Message Analysis

Conducted comprehensive query analysis to understand what errors users were actually experiencing

#### Volume-Based Issue Prioritization

Discovered that employee/manager mapping was the highest count issue through data analysis

#### Line-by-Line Error Investigation

Systematically documented error meanings, use cases, current fixes, and responsible parties

### **Phase 2: AI-Powered Automation Solution**

#### Knowledge Base Integration

Fed research findings into an AI system via Excel documentation of error statuses and resolution steps

#### Database Integration

Brought import statuses into the database for real-time AI learning and analysis

#### Automated Ticket Generation

AI bot auto-generates Salesforce tickets for internal XSLT and configuration updates

## **Measurable Business Impact**

**Significant Volume Reduction**  
Support ticket volume decreased through automated resolution  
**Root Cause Identification**  
Traced majority of issues to configuration problems  
**Process Documentation**  
First comprehensive documentation of imports architecture  
**Team Efficiency**  
Automated internal error resolution and updates

## **Cross-Functional Collaboration**

### **Strategic Partnerships**

#### Product Team

Collaborated to prioritize backlog items, focusing on employee/manager mapping solutions based on research findings

#### Engineering Team

Worked closely to implement database integration for import statuses and AI bot development

#### Support Team

Leveraged their deep knowledge of legacy constraints to inform AI training and solution design

## **Lessons Learned & Future Vision**

### **Key Learnings**

* Legacy systems require systematic research before solution implementation  
* AI can effectively bridge the gap between complex legacy constraints and modern user expectations  
* Internal process optimization should precede customer-facing improvements for maximum impact  
* Cross-functional collaboration is essential when dealing with systems that span multiple domains

### **Future Vision**

As the AI bot continues to learn from patterns and resolutions, the next phase will focus on customer empowerment through intelligent, contextual guidance.

#### Next Phase: Self-Service Intelligence

The AI will auto-generate solutions and mapping suggestions directly within the application, transforming imports from a support burden into a seamless, intelligent user experience that learns and adapts to individual client configurations.
